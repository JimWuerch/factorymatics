1.0.0+2
- Fixed:  If you run out of resource storage but still have unused acquire products and then try to end the turn, you'll get a warning you have unused products.
- Added: Game displays a message while other players are taking their turn.

1.0.0+3
- Fixed: Game would freeze with "loading..." screen if player tried to search when they weren't allowed.

1.0.0+4
- Fixed: If more than 4 parts were searched, they could flow off the edge of the screen.

1.0.0+5
- Fixed: AI player would crash if the level 1 store ran out and it tried to do an acquire action, leaving the game waiting for user input.

1.0.0+6
- Fixed: Part 77 didn't work.
- Fixed: Part 53 will no longer trigger itself
- Fixed: Part 89 didn't work. (Free L1 construct)

1.0.0+7
- Fixed a crash associated with Search
- Fixed a crash when AI had no legal actions
- Improved AI by disallowing rollout turns from taking more than 5 converters.  Having lots of converters was making the AI take forever to process a turn.
- Changed AI turn termination rules.  Now a selected play can require a minimum number of occurrances before considering the turn timer.

1.0.0+8
- Fixed crash when AI's only option on a turn was to search.  The AI will try to search in that case.
- Changed how the AI calculates moves, to get it to try to finish the game around turn 20.
- Improvements to how calculating payments, resulting in the AI being able to run more simulations in the same time period.
- Reverted how the AI chooses actions during a rollout, to get better results by trying to force the AI to consider constructing first.
